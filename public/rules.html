<h1>Tic Tac Toe Rules</h1>
<p>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</p>
<p>You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</p>
<p>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</p>
<p>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.</p>
